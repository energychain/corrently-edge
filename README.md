## Audience

Corrently Edge is aimed at smart-home owners who are seeking a simple and effective solution for integrating and controlling their diverse smart-home devices. It targets users who desire seamless communication between their devices and wish to reduce the complexity of integration. Corrently Edge is suitable for both residential and commercial applications and is ideal for users who want a central interface to efficiently manage their smart-home devices.

## Problem

When operating a smart-home, integrating and controlling various devices often poses challenges. The multitude of manufacturers, protocols, and standards makes it difficult to establish a unified and seamless connection between the devices. Additionally, many smart-home systems require constant device connectivity and communication, which can strain networks.

This problem is addressed through the development of Corrently Edge. Corrently Edge is a specialized device designed as an "always-on" solution, serving as an interface between different smart-home devices and the user. It resolves the integration and control issues that can arise in conventional smart-home systems.

Corrently Edge enables smooth and efficient communication between the diverse devices, regardless of their manufacturer or protocol. It acts as a central hub, retrieving data from the source devices and presenting it in a unified format. This reduces the complexity of integration as users no longer need to navigate the various interfaces and protocols of individual devices.

Another problem that Corrently Edge solves is network relief. By centralizing data retrieval and processing, the need for constant communication between devices is eliminated, leading to more efficient utilization of network resources. This is particularly beneficial in larger smart-home environments with a high number of devices.

Corrently Edge provides a solution for the integration and control of smart-home devices that combines user-friendliness, efficiency, and network relief. It enables a seamless connection of devices and simplifies the usage and management of the smart-home.
